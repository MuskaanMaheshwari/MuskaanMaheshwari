ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, fellow explorer of code and curiosity!

ðŸš€ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a robotics enthusiast and software engineer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology. From coding to robotics, I'm all about turning ideas into reality through clean code and innovative solutions.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm diving deep into building an Adaptive System for an Autonomous Bike, where I'm combining my expertise in ROS to create exciting automation and robotics applications. I love tackling complex challenges and finding elegant solutions.

ðŸŒ± I believe in the power of continuous learning and exploration. You'll find a mix of personal projects, code experiments, and collaborations that reflect my curiosity for emerging technologies and their real-world applications.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect! I'm always up for discussions and collaborations. Whether it's robotics, software development, or just geeking out about the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out. You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muskaan-maheshwari-0103/) as well.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, experimenting with cooking, or diving into a captivating sci-fi novel.
